# Multi-Factor Login

The multi-factor login allows a user to gain access to an application by entering their authentication information step by step, such as username and password. For additional login methods, see:
- [Login Page](https://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/application-framework/login-page/#)
- [Single Sign-On](https://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/application-framework/single-sign-on/#)

## Identity First
For identity first, a user will input the username and password separately and may not be required to enter a password if other authentication mechanisms are used (for example fingerprint, two-way ssl, etc.). Also, it allows automatically redirecting to an external IdP when the user is linked to an external IdP.
