## Vertical Navigation
It is recommended to use vertical navigation when your application requires global navigation that is displayed on the left. While vertical navigation menus generally consume more space than their horizontal counterparts, they have become more popular as desktop monitors move to wide-screen formats. Vertical navigations have several advantages:

* They are scalable. The number of menu items is not constrained by the viewport 	width.
* Vertical menus more readily adapt to small screen sizes. While horizontal menus can 	also be made responsive, it usually requires a transformation from horizontal to vertical. 	* Since vertical menus are already in this format, the transition from desktop to mobile 	is less disorienting.
* Vertical navigation supports common left to right flow. Navigation categories are easily 	differentiated from other information that may exist in the header area of the 	application.

The vertical navigation pattern supports up to three levels of navigation (Primary, Secondary and Tertiary). Each navigation item does not have to have the same number of levels of navigation. To illustrate this, look at the example below:

* The "Dashboard" category has no secondary navigation items
* The "Ipsum" category has secondary level navigation items
* The "Amet" category may have some secondary items which have tertiary navigation items

## Vertical Navigation Options

| Jump to...        | Use when...  |
| ----------------- |:-------------:|
| [Vertical Navigation with Full Column](#vertical-navigation-with-full-column) | the list of secondary items is long and needs room to grow. Also, consider this if a tertiary navigation is needed. Persistent Option: Consider making this column persistent if the user is going to want to navigate to other sections often or continue to scan the list of sections. |
| [Vertical Navigation with Flyout](#vertical-navigation-with-flyout)      | the list of secondary items is short and doesnâ€™t need to be accessed often.      |
